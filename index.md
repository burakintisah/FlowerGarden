This webpage will be used to publish the documents of the term project of *CS353 - Database Systems* course in Bilkent University (2019-2020 Spring).

## Project Info

In this project, we have proposed, designed, and implemented an online flower shopping system, FlowerGarden. We’ve provided a user-friendly interface for the users of our application: customers, sellers, couriers, and customer services. We tried to design a complete system that is suitable to adopt as a real system to be able to see the challenges of designing a system that considers the different needs of different types of users. We think that we achieved our goal because we provided all the essentials required by our users to use our application as they wish. The sellers of the application choose the districts they serve and when they serve in those districts. Then, they can add custom flower arrangements based on the flowers they select to add. The customers can buy these arrangements if they want to send a flower arrangement to a district where that seller serves. To make it more real we added several options for customers in the order creation page, they can customize their deliveries by selecting the desired delivery type & date and even message for the seller if they want something special. The sellers can assign couriers to their orders if the couriers work in the corresponding district and timeslot.
